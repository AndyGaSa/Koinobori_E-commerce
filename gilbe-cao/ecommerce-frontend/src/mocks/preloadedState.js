      description: "Our flagship beer that kick started the craft beer revolution. This is James and Martin's original take on an American IPA, subverted with punchy New Zealand hops. Layered with new world hops to create an all-out riot of grapefruit, pineapple and lychee before a spiky, mouth-puckering bitter finish.",

      description: 'Cloudberry, lingonberry, blueberry and sea buckthorn meld with citrusy hops in an intensely sweet, fruity and floral aroma, with toasty malt notes and tropical fruit bursts. This bitter, resinous IPA follows up with a lemony punch in the mouth - cherry and blueberry sourness takes this pithy pale ale in a new direction before a long, dry finish.',
