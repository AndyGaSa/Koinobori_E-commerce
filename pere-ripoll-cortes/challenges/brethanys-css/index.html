                <br>
                <p>For many years, <b>Bethany</b> has been baking the most delicious pies at her home. In 2013, we opened our firts store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the world fell in love with the soft cakes, heavenly chesses cakes, spicy apple pies... <br> <i>The store became a successin no time</i></p>
                <br>
                <p>In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved into larger building. After receiving many requests, it became clear that out next step was making it possible to order pies from the comfort of you own home and from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the rest of this: our very own webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like it</p>
