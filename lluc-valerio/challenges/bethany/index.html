                <h2>Our history</h2>
                <p>For many years, <strong>Bethany</strong> has been baking the most delicious pies at her home. In
                    2013, we
                    opened our first store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People
                    from
                    all over the world fell in love with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies... </p>
                <p>The store became a success in no time</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved into a larger
                    building.
                    After receiving many requests, it became clear that our next step was making it possible to order
                    pies
                    from the comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the result
                    of
                    this: our very own webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you fell
                    like
                    it!</p>
