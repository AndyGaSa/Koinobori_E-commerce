                I developed from scratch a Wordpress site for a neighbourhood association. I had to assume all technical
                decissions and dessign decisions.<br>
                The main purpose was to make it beauty and readable to as much people possible.<br>
                We toke a super effort on making it easy to the older ones and not experimented on digital
                technologies.<br>
                The UX had to be very simple and intuitive; That whas cause is the main consumer of this nonprofit org.

                It was a delicated project cause i have to make sure the users dont lose any mail or sensible info in
                the migration of the data.

                Spent 5 months on Planeta working as a Support Technician from a Call Center.<br>
                I had to pick up calls and sometimes attend in-site users and solve any problem they might have.<br>
                I learned a lot about ticketing tools and the importance of them.<br>
                We used Team Viewer to execute the remote help.<br>
                I had to learn a lot about differents OS and make my self a all-road IT technician. I developed the
                ability to solve any problem i knew before how to solve it or not.
